# PacMen
This project creates a number of PacMen and sets them moving across the screen, bouncing off the edges of their window. Each one's initial direction and speed are random. 

How to run: download files into a folder and open Index.html in your broweser.

In the future, I hope to add certian acceleration effects and gravity to simulate more realistic bouncing.
